## React Todo App with Styled Components & Theming
This repository showcases a simple yet structured Todo application built using React. A major emphasis of this project is on the use of Styled Components for component-specific styling, along with Global Styles and a Theme for consistent app-wide design. Alongside this, the repo demonstrates essential React hooks, specifically useState, to manage application state for adding and removing todo items.

### Key Features
1. Styled Components: \
Each component in this repo is styled using the styled-components library, promoting CSS-in-JS patterns. This ensures component-specific styles, minimizing the risk of styles bleeding into other unrelated components. \
2. Global Styles: \
The application uses a global style sheet to maintain consistent app-wide styles, such as font settings, default margins, and more. This ensures that the base design remains consistent across the app.
3. Theming: \
The app leverages the theming capabilities of styled-components. This allows for consistent use of colors, spacings, and more across all components, making the design more maintainable and adaptable to changes.
4. React useState Hook: \
This repository demonstrates the power and simplicity of the useState hook. The app's main functionality, adding and removing todo items, is achieved using this hook, providing a practical demonstration of state management in functional components.
